## Installation

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shivaprasad2426/DataScience_Assignment.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the repository directory:**

    ```bash
    cd DataScience_Assignment
    ```

3. **Install the necessary dependencies:**

    Make sure you have `pip` and `virtualenv` installed. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

    Install the required packages using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Each assignment is implemented in its own Jupyter Notebook. To run the notebooks:

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. **Open the desired notebook:**
   Navigate to the notebook you want to explore and open it in your web browser.

3. **Run the cells:**
   Execute the cells in the notebook to see the implementations and results.
